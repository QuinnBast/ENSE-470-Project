Software users must request access to specific components of the software to use based on their access.

Steps:
Software users request access to software tools by obtaining approval from a verified and unique software approver for the specific tool.
	-This is done by getting the approver's signature, digital signature, or email approval.
	-Users often don't know who the approver for the software tool is and go to the wrong people
	-Users try to obtain approval from their managers but they are not authorized to give access
Once approval is gained, the user's request is submitted to HELL IT Staff for vetting and processing
HELL IT Staff recieves requests via email, fax and web
	-Non web submitted documents usually lack information and require runbacks
	-Vetting requires the IT Staff to confirm the user should have the access being requested
	-Software approver names are held in two different files managed by two different teams
	-All approvers on either list are verified. Analyst must search both files as some are duplicated or ommitted in the two files. Acronyms sometimes used
After vetting is completed, approval is confirmed and the analyst processes the user's access. If approval is denied they have to resubmit.
